        <p>☛ A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, in full Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, was born on October 15, 1931,<br> in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, India.</p>
        <p>☛ He served as the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007.</p>
        <p>☛ Kalam earned a degree in aeronautical engineering from the Madras Institute of Technology and in<br>1958 joined the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO).</p>
        <p>☛ In 1969, he moved to the Indian Space Research Organisation, where he was project director of the <br> SLV-III, the first satellite launch vehicle that was both designed and produced in India.</p>
        <p>☛ Rejoining DRDO in 1982, Kalam planned the program that produced a number of successful missiles, <br> which helped earn him the nickname <b>"Missile Man."</b></p>
        <p>☛ Among those successes was Agni, India's first intermediate-range ballistic missile, which<br> incorporated aspects of the SLV-III and was launched in 1989.</p>
        <p>☛ He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests<br> in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.</p>
        <p>☛ From 1992 to 1997 Kalam was scientific adviser to the defense minister, and he later served as principal<br> scientific adviser (1999-2001) to the government with the rank of cabinet minister. </p>
        <p>☛ His prominent role in the country's 1998 nuclear weapons tests solidified India as a nuclear power and <br>established Kalam as a national hero, although the tests caused great concern in the international<br> community.</p>
        <p>☛ In 1998 Kalam put forward a countrywide plan called Technology Vision 2020, which he described as a<br> road map for transforming India from a less-developed to a developed society in 20 years. The plan called<br> for, among other measures, increasing agricultural productivity, emphasizing technology as a vehicle for<br> economic growth, and widening access to health care and education.</p>
        <p>☛ Kalam received 7 honorary doctorates from <b>40</b> universities. The Government of India honoured him <br> with the <b>Padma Bhushan in 1981</b> and the <b>Padma Vibhushan in 1990</b> for his work with ISRO and<br> DRDO and his role as a scientific advisor to the Government.</p>
        <p>☛ In 1997, Kalam received India's highest civilian honour, the Bharat Ratna, for his contribution to the<br> scientific research and modernisation of defence technology in India.</p>
        <p>☛ In 2013, he was the recipient of the Von Braun Award from the National Space Society "to recognize <br>excellence in the management and leadership of a space-related project".</p>
        <p>☛ While delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong, Kalam collapsed and died<br> from an apparent cardiac arrest on <b>27 July 2015</b>, aged 83.</p>
        <p>☛ Wheeler Island, a national missile test site in Odisha, was renamed Kalam Island in September 2015.</p>
        <p>☛ A prominent road in New Delhi was renamed from Aurangzeb Road to <b>Dr APJ Abdul Kalam Road</b><br> in August 2015.</p>
        <p>☛ In February 2018, scientists from the Botanical Survey of India named a newly found plant species as<br> Drypetes kalamii, in his honour.</p>
